* Wed Dec 13 2017 Trevor Vaughan <tvaughan@onyxpoint.com> - 6.1.0

  been deprecated
- Added the ports '111' and $rquotad_port to the list of ports to be
  opened by iptables in the non-stunnel version. This is due to the
  fact that the 'quota' command has not been modified to use the
  single interface instance of NFSv4.

* Mon Jan 07 2013 Kendall Moore <kmoore@keywcorp.com> - 2.0.0-11

  connect with itself. The stock classes should "just work" now.

* Wed Nov 02 2011 Maintenance
2.0.0-5
- Added a parameterized class to handle the configuration of idmapd. In RHEL5
  this was not necessary as the defaults handled most cases. In RHEL6, the
  defaults do not suffice for the stock class.

  between the RHEL5 and RHEL6 versions.

  services that rely on those values.
