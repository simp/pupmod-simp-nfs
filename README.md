## Description

The SIMP nfs module can manage the exporting and mounting of nfs devices. It provides all the infrastructure needed to share a folder over the network.

The module is broken into two parts: the server and the client. It supports security with either krb5 or stunnel, but not both. The services conflict at a system level.


### This is a SIMP module

This module is a component of the [System Integrity Management Platform](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/SIMP), a compliance-management framework built on Puppet.

If you find any issues, they may be submitted to our [bug tracker](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/).

This module is optimally designed for use within a larger SIMP ecosystem, but it can be used independently:

 * When included within the SIMP ecosystem, security compliance settings will be managed from the Puppet server.
 * If used independently, all SIMP-managed security subsystems are disabled by default and must be explicitly opted into by administrators.  Please review the `$client_nets`, `$enable_*` and `$use_*` parameters in `manifests/init.pp` for details.


## Setup


### Setup Requirements

The only thing necessary to begin using nfs is to install pupmod-simp-nfs and pupmod-simp-autofs into your modulepath.


### Beginning with nfs

To get started with this module, a few settings have to be set in hiera.

To be applied to all nodes, in `default.yaml`:

``` yaml
nfs::server: "your.server.fqdn"
nfs::server::client_ips: "%{alias('client_nets')}"
nfs::simp_iptables: true
```

On the node intended to be the server:

``` yaml
nfs::is_server: true

classes:
  - 'site::nfs_server'
```

On a node intended to be a client:

``` yaml
classes:
  - 'site::nfs_client'
```

## Usage


### Basic Usage

In order to export `/srv/nfs_share` and mount it as `/mnt/nfs` on a client, you need to create a couple of profile classes.

One to be added to the node intended to be the server, to define the exported path:

``` puppet
class site::nfs_server {
  include '::nfs'

  file { '/srv/nfs_share':
    ensure => 'directory',
    owner  => 'root',
    group  => 'root',
    mode   => '0644'
  }

  nfs::server::export { 'nfs4_root':
    client      => ['*'],
    export_path => '/srv/nfs_share',
    sec         => ['sys'],
    require     => File['/srv/nfs_share']
  }
}
```

And another profile class to be added to a node intended to be a client, to mount the exported filesystem on a node. Note that all that is needed is the native Puppet `mount` resource:

``` puppet
class site::nfs_client {
  include '::nfs'

  file { '/mnt/nfs':
    ensure => 'directory',
    mode => '755',
    owner => 'root',
    group => 'root'
  }

  mount { "/mnt/nfs":
    ensure  => 'mounted',
    fstype  => 'nfs4',
    device  => '<your_server_fqdn>:/srv/nfs_share',
    options => 'sec=sys'
    require => File['/mnt/nfs']
  }
}
```


### Usage with krb5

This module, used with the [SIMP krb5 module](https://github.com/simp/pupmod-simp-krb5), can automatically use kerberos to secure the exported filesystem. The module can create and manage the entire kerberos configuration automatically, but check the krb5 module itself if you want more control.

Modify the examples provided above to include the following hieradata:

To be applied on every node in `default.yaml`:

``` yaml
simp_krb5: true

nfs::secure_nfs: true

krb5::kdc::auto_keytabs::global_services:
  - 'nfs'
```

On the node intended to be the server, add `krb5::kdc` to the class list:

``` yaml
classes:
  - 'krb5::kdc'
```

There are no changes required for any client-specific hieradata.

### Automatic mounting of home directories

Please reference the [SIMP documentation](http://simp.readthedocs.io/en/master/user_guide/HOWTO/NFS.html#exporting-home-directories) for details on how to implement this feature.


## Limitations

SIMP Puppet modules are generally intended for use on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and compatible distributions, such as CentOS. Please see the [`metadata.json` file](./metadata.json) for the most up-to-date list of supported operating systems, Puppet versions, and module dependencies.


## Development

Please read our [Contribution Guide](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/Contributing+to+SIMP) and visit our [developer wiki](https://simp-project.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SD/SIMP+Development+Home).


### Acceptance tests

This module includes [Beaker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker) acceptance tests using the SIMP [Beaker Helpers](https://github.com/simp/rubygem-simp-beaker-helpers).  By default the tests use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) as a back-end; Vagrant and VirtualBox must both be installed to run these tests without modification. To execute the tests run the following:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rake beaker:suites
```

Please refer to the [SIMP Beaker Helpers documentation](https://github.com/simp/rubygem-simp-beaker-helpers/blob/master/README.md) for more information.
