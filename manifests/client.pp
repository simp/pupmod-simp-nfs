# Set up the iptables hooks and the sysctl settings that are required for NFS
# to function properly on a client system.
#
# If using the ``nfs::client::stunnel::connect`` define, this will be
# automatically called for you.
#
# @param nfs_servers
#   NFS servers that will be calling back to the callback port for NFSv4
#
# @param is_server
#   Lets this class know *explicitly* that the ``$nfs_servers`` contains the
#   host that the class is applying on. This is important to avoid conflicts
#   with the target server running on the same host under a different
#   hostname/alias.
#
#   * The ``File[/etc/exports]`` resource will conflict if you have a system that
#     is both a server and client for itself but can't determine that from
#     introspection
#
# @param callback_port
#   The callback port
#
# @param stunnel
#   Enable ``stunnel`` connections for this system
#
#   * Will *attempt* to determine if the server is trying to connect to itself
#
#   * If connecting to itself, will not use stunnel, otherwise will use stunnel
#
#   * If you are using host aliases for your NFS server names, this check
#     may fail and you may need to disable ``$stunnel`` explicitly
#
# @param firewall
#   Use the SIMP IPTables module to manipulate the firewall settings
